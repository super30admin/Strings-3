# Solution

# // Time Complexity : O(1) Since maximum size is 2^31 - 1, maximum depth of division is three 
# // Space Complexity : O(1) Since maximum size is 2^31 - 1, maximum depth of division is three 
# // Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# // Any problem you faced while coding this : None


# // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Have three lists, one list for number less than 20, one for all the tens and one for the million, billion and thousand.
# Using modulus and division and recursion we can map the numbers and lists to find the exact number to string conversion
