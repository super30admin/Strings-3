# Solution

# // Time Complexity : Stack Approach: O(2N) it is almost like we are going over the string twice, since we are storing everything
#                      in stack and popping it all again in the end to add it
#                      Variable Approach: O(N) we just iterate over the string characters once
# // Space Complexity : Stack Approach: O(N) since we save each number in stack and process the values when we get *
#                       Variable Approach: O(1)
# // Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# // Any problem you faced while coding this : Floor division, should remember that if numerator is negative, then flooring
# takes value to smaller value leading to taking -2.5 to -3 instead of -2. Remember to skip spaces. Remember that we might
# get double/tirple/more digits so use lv_curr*10 + string[i] to form multiple digits.


# // Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# Stack Approach
# We can keep appending the numbers into stack with their sign, the moment we come across "*" or "/" we need to pop the previous
# value, perform the operation and add it back to stack. Once the entire string is processed, we need to just go over the entire
# stack and take a sum to get the result
# Variable Approach
# We should use four temp variables to hold current value, operation pending to be performed, tail value(needed to remove from
# calculated value, if we come across division or multiplication). As we iterate over array, remember to skip spaces and we might
# get double/tirple/more digits so use lv_curr*10 + string[i] to form multiple digits.
