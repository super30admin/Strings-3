Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
Any problem you faced while coding this : No


Your code here along with comments explaining your approach:
Here, we calculate numbers and put them inside stack. We also maintain a last sign. Whenever we see a new sign,
we check for last sign and perform necessary actions.
